This part of the project documentation focuses on a
**learning-oriented** approach. You'll learn how to
get started with the code in this project, for an 
example function of **area_of_rectangle**.

## Description
Provide a function to calculate the area of a rectangle.

## Prerequisites
Download the code from this GitHub repository and place
the `example/` folder in the same directory as your
Python script.

## Steps
- Step 1: Import the function you needed to calculate 
the area of a rectangle.

- Step 2: Give the value of width and height in your code.
For example, width = 10, height = 2.

- Step 3: Input the values of step 2 to the function.

- Step 4: Run the function.

- Step 5: Finally, print the result and you will get the 
area of that specific rectangle.
