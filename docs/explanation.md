# Function: area_of_rectangle

## Introduction
To calculate the area of a rectangle like a calculator.

## Detailed Explanation
In reality, we cannot know the area of a rectangle directly. What we can measure is the width and height.
After we get the width and height, we need to calculate the area. This function can help us do this.

## Example
For example, we have a rectangle. We can measure the width and height directly. 
The width is 10, and the height is 2. We just need to input the numbers to the function.
It will give us the area directly. The result would be 20.
